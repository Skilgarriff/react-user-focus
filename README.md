# react-user-focus

react-user-focus is a Reactjs component that communicates the state of the user's focus (focused, idle, away). The purpose of this component is to allow user-dependent processes such as animations, and communication to be aware of the current state of the user's focus.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-user-focus is to install it from NPM or Yarn and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

```
npm install react-user-focus --save
```

or

```
yarn add react-user-focus
```


## Usage

react-user-focus can contain children, or be rendered simply by itself.

```
import ReactUserFocus from 'react-user-focus';

<ReactUserFocus
  onFocusChange={onFocusChange}
  onIdleChange={onIdleChange}
  idleTime={2}
/>
```

### Properties

react-user-focus currently has 3 properties can that can be included when rendering the component.

+ onFocusChange - accepts a function that is called with the parameter of isHidden when the focus of the user changes.

```
import ReactUserFocus from 'react-user-focus';

function onFocusChange(isHidden) {
  console.log(`Is hidden?:${isHidden}`);
}

<ReactUserFocus
  onFocusChange={onFocusChange}
/>
```

+ onIdleChange - accepts a function that is called with the parameter of isIdle when the idleness of a user changes.

+ idleTime - the amount of time (in seconds) with no engagement to consider a user as idle.

```
import ReactUserFocus from 'react-user-focus';

function onIdleChange(isIdle) {
  console.log(`Is Idle?:${isIdle}`);
}

<ReactUserFocus
  onIdleChange={onIdleChange}
  idleTime={2}
/>
```


## Demo & Examples

Live demo - To see a live demo of this component, visit my website: [SeanKilgarriff.com](https://seankilgarriff.com). Open up the console in developer tools, and type AmIFocused?() into the console.

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in a browser. If you have other webpack dev servers running, the ports will be incremental - 8081, 8082, etc.
